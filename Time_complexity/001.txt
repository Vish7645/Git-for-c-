all operation in map is of O(logN);

count()  ->  O(N);

erase() in string and vector also -> O(N); N is size
in map Or set : erase(a,b) -> O(O(s.find(num))) or O(1) or O(a,b);

clear() -> O(N);

inserting in vector push_back(x) -> O(1);
inserting in set push_back(x) -> O(log(N)); N is current size


upper_bound() && lower_bound() --> O(log(N));
